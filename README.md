# 07_softdev_svg

Recreate your connect the dots html/javacsript program using SVG instead of the canvas.

+ Every time the user clicks inside the SVG area, a circle should be drawn.
+ After the first circle, every subsequent click should also result in a line from from the previous circle to the next.
+ Include a clear button
    - clearRect() will not work, that is a canvas method. You need to remove all the circles somehow...
